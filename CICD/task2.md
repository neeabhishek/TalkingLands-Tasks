Scenario:
Set up a CI/CD pipeline to build, test, and deploy a simple Node.js application.

Requirements:
1. The pipeline should:
 * Run on GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline.
 * Install dependencies.
 * Package the application as a Docker container.
 * Deploy the container to a Kubernetes cluster (use Minikube, kind, or a cloud provider).
2. Rollback deployment if any step fails.
